DELETE
This method deletes the specified resource.

CONNECT
This method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

OPTIONS
This method describes the communication options for the target resource.

Q2. How you do make HTTP requests via axios?

> npm install axios


> In the browser, you can include it in your page using unpkg.com:

>   <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

>    You can start an HTTP request from the axios object:

  Example :  axios({
  url: 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all',
  method: 'get'
})
